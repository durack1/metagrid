## Summary

This is the 'Globus Transfer' update! You now have the ability to select a Globus Transfer option within the data cart (for select Globus Ready datasets). When transferring with Globus, you will be redirected to provide permission and to select your desired endpoint. Then you'll be able to save your endpoint as default and start the Globus transfer process. Since this is a brand new feature, there is a chance things will not work perfectly but we hope to address issues and make future improvements and updates as we move forward.
